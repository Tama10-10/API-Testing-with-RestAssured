# 🧪 API Testing with Rest Assured

## 📘 Project Overview
This project demonstrates **API testing automation** using **Rest Assured** for the [Daily Finance application](https://dailyfinance.roadtocareer.net/).  
The main goal of this project is to verify different API functionalities such as user registration, authentication, item management, and data manipulation through both **manual testing using Postman** and **automated testing using Rest Assured**.

## 🚀 Features Tested
The following API endpoints were inspected from the browser’s **Network tab** and tested using both **Postman** and **Rest Assured**:

### 👥 User Management
- **Register a new user**
- **Admin login** (`email: admin@test.com`, `password: admin123`)
- **Get user list**
- **Search user by user ID**
- **Edit user information** (e.g., first name, phone number)
- **Login as a normal user**

### 📦 Item Management
- **Get item list**
- **Add a new item**
- **Edit item name**
- **Delete item from item list**

## ⚙️ Automation Details
The automated test suite is developed using **Java**, **Rest Assured**, and **TestNG**, following the **Page Object Model (POM)** architecture for better modularity and maintainability.  
Both **positive** and **negative test cases** have been included to ensure robust validation of API responses, data consistency, and authentication rules.
